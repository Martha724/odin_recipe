    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>shortcrust pastry </li>
        <li>1 tbsp raspberry jam </li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>caster sugar</li>
        <li>ground almonds and almond extract</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line the pastry case with kitchen foil and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for about 15 minutes, then remove the beans and foil and cook for a further 5 minutes to dry out the base.</li>
        <li>For the filing, spread the base of the flan generously with raspberry jam.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pan, take off the heat and then stir in the sugar. Add ground almonds, egg and almond extract. Pour into the flan tin and sprinkle over the flaked almonds.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 35 minutes. If the almonds seem to be browning too quickly, cover the tart loosely with foil to prevent them burning.        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sift the icing sugar into a bowl. Stir in 2Â½ teaspoons cold water and transfer to a piping bag.        </li>
        <li>Once you have removed the tart from the oven, pipe or drizzle the icing over the top, giving an informal zig zag effect.        </li>
    </ol>
